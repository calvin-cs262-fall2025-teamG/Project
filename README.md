## Vision Statement:
  *Hey, Neighbor!* makes it easy for Calvin University students to save money, reduce waste, and build stronger connections by borrowing and lending items they rarely use like textbooks, tools, or school supplies within a trusted campus network. Instead of letting these items gather dust, students can turn them into shared possibilities, creating a more sustainable, collaborative, and connected community.
 
  Unlike the Calvin Bookstore, which requires purchasing, or rental services like Yoodilize, which charge fees and lack a local community focus, *Hey, Neighbor!* offers a free, peer-to-peer platform that combines the convenience of a rental service with the social involvement of a neighborhood network. Thus, making *Hey, Neighbor!* not just practical, but valuable for campus life.
